# Exploratory-Testing-on-Sololearn-app
Exploratory Testing is a type of software testing where Test cases are not created in advance but testers check system on the fly. They may note down ideas about what to test before test execution. The focus of exploratory testing is more on testing as a “thinking” activity.

# Why Exploratory Testing?
Because It will help an Agile team define and develop the application throughout its lifecycle. An exploratory tester asks questions of the application that scripted testing can't. This helps the development team write better code to improve the application's quality.
